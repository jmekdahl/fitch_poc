				Fitch Ratings's CLO Indenture Abstracts provide unprecedented insight into the key features of the CLO
				indenture and how those features compare to other Fitch-rated CLOs. An Indenture Abstract will be published
				for every Fitch-rated U.S. CLO 2.0.
			</p>
			<p>
				In each report, Fitch reviews and describes the following indenture features:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Collateral quality tests;</li>
				<li>Concentration limitations;</li>
				<li>Coverage tests;</li>
				<li>Priority of payments;</li>
				<li>Conditions to reinvestment;</li>
				<li>Events of default;</li>
				<li>Manager replacement provisions;</li>
				<li>Call provisions;</li>
				<li>Indenture amendments; and</li>
				<li>Reporting requirements</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				As investors continue to deal with rapidly growing CLO volume, their ability to dissect and digest the
				transaction documents presents an increasing challenge. CLO indentures lack uniformity and evolve over time
				to reflect current changes in the underlying loan market. Fitch's CLO Indenture Abstracts are aimed at easing
				this burden by highlighting the indenture features that investors have indicated are most critical in their
				analysis.
